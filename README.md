# BlackjackProject

# Description
This program is based off the card game, Blackjack. The objective of this game is for the user to create a hand of cards that are higher than those held by the dealer, but do not exceed 21 points. Points are based off a cards face value, with Aces being worth 11 points. The dealer must hit if their total is 16 or less, but will hold on any values 17 or higher. A Blackjack is an automatic win for the player that holds it (Ace and 10).
